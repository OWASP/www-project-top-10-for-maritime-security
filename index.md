# [OWASP Top 10 for Maritime Security][2]
![alt text](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-maritime-security/blob/main/assets/images/icon.jpeg)

This project aims to develop an OWASP Top 10 list specifically tailored to the maritime industry.  Currently, maritime cybersecurity lacks well-defined standards, and this project leverages the OWASP framework to address this gap.

The project will identify the ten most critical security vulnerabilities facing the maritime sector:

* Gathering and analyzing existing maritime vulnerability data.
* Prioritizing the most frequent and impactful threats.
* Developing detailed descriptions for each vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 for Maritime list.

This will provide a foundational framework for risk management and vulnerability mitigation, ultimately strengthening maritime cybersecurity.

### Road Map
The project will follow a phased approach, with each phase building upon the previous one:

#### Phase 1: 
Data Collection and Analysis: Gather maritime vulnerability data, clean and analyze it, identify key vulnerabilities and emerging threats.

#### Phase 2: 
OWASP Top 10 for Maritime Development: Prioritize vulnerabilities, develop detailed descriptions for each in the Top 10 list, and finalize the report.

#### Phase 3: 
Deliverables and Outreach: Finalize all project deliverables, prepare for dissemination of results (presentations, communication strategy), and raise awareness of the OWASP Top 10 for Maritime list.

### Get Involved
We invite maritime security experts, researchers, and industry practitioners to contribute to this project. Your expertise is invaluable in identifying and addressing the most critical security challenges facing the maritime industry.

We've begun the first phase of our project: gathering data on maritime security vulnerabilities. We're inviting everyone to contribute publicly available information to our project. You can upload your data to the public section of our data collection area.

If you have data that includes sensitive information but can be shared publicly after removing private details, please upload it to the private section. We'll review this data to determine if it can be made public.
